# ChessBot
This is a small project where I try to implement a 
chess ai in a very small amount of time.
Please note that this is more of a proof of concept 
following my previous project 4ChessBot and will 
most likely be my last venture into AI and games.

# Requirements:
- 8gb ram
- g++
- Premake (included)

# Features:
- Premake build script for all platforms 
- Bash scripts for more automated building
- Single threaded architecture
- Hand made testing framework
- Fen loading support
- Bitboard encoding of the board (LERF)
- Negamax framework for alphabeta
- Quiescence search w/ standing pat
- Move ordering (MVV-LA)
- Transposition tables with PV, CUT, ALL node cutoffs
- Iterative deepening
- Thread safe move timer
- Game loop with custom algebraic move notation

# Unsupported features:
- Castling
- True algebraic moves
- Parallel search

Realistically adding support for the unsupported 
features would be spending time on a relatively 
minor part of the project that I would not rather 
spend. Thank you for checking this out!
